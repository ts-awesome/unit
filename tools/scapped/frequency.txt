<link>http://conversion.org/frequency/radians-per-day/</link><b>Radians per day</b> is  <a>frequency</a> unit, symbol: [rad/day]. Definition of 1 radians per day  = Hz/(2 × π × 86400). Radians per day is the unit of angular velocity used for very slow rotation speeds. From this, we can calculate the number of rotations per day. 1 Hertz = 1 / (2 π 86400).
<link>http://conversion.org/frequency/radians-per-hour/</link><b>Radians per hour</b> is  <a>frequency</a> unit, symbol: [rad/h]. Definition of 1 radians per hour  = Hz/(2 × π × 3600). Radians per hour is the unit of angular velocity. It can be converted into turns per day (or second) unit of frequency..
<link>http://conversion.org/frequency/radians-per-minute/</link><b>Radians per minute</b> is  <a>frequency</a> unit, symbol: [rad/min]. Definition of 1 radians per minute  = Hz/(2 × π × 60). Radian per minute is actually a unit of angular velocity, but since radian is dimensionless unit, rotations per minute can be calculated (the frequency)..
<link>http://conversion.org/frequency/radians-per-second/</link><b>Radians per second</b> is  <a>frequency</a> unit, symbol: [rad/s]. Definition of 1 radians per second  = Hz/(2 × π). Radian per second is actually a unit of angular velocity, but radian can be treated as a dimensionless number. According to this, angular velocity can be converted directly into rotations per second. One hertz is equal to (2×π×rad) / s. [rad / s] is derived SI unit of measure..
