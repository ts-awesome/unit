Watt; power; W; p,n,μ,m,k,M,G,T,P;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt; 1 kg⋅m^2⋅s^−3; The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as kg⋅m^2⋅s^−3. The watt is named after James Watt, an 18th-century Scottish inventor.
Coulomb; electric charge; C; p,n,μ,m;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb; 1 A⋅s; The coulomb (symbol: C) is the International System of Units (SI) unit of electric charge. Under the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units, which took effect on 20 May 2019, the coulomb is exactly 1/(1.602176634×10−19) (which is approximately 6.2415090744×1018, or 1.0364269656×10−5 mol) elementary charges. The same number of electrons has the same magnitude but opposite sign of charge, that is, a charge of −1 C.
Volt; electric potential; V; p,n,μ,m,k;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt; 1 kg·m^2·s^−3·A^−1; The volt (symbol: V) is the derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force. It is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827).
Farad; electrical capacitance; F; p,n,μ,m;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farad; 1 s^4⋅A^2⋅m^−2⋅kg^−1; The farad (symbol: F) is the SI derived unit of electrical capacitance, the ability of a body to store an electrical charge. It is named after the English physicist Michael Faraday.
Ohm; electrical resistance; Ω,ohm; k,M;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm; 1 kg⋅m^2⋅s^−3⋅A^−2; The ohm (symbol: Ω) is the SI derived unit of electrical resistance, named after German physicist Georg Ohm. Various empirically derived standard units for electrical resistance were developed in connection with early telegraphy practice, and the British Association for the Advancement of Science proposed a unit derived from existing units of mass, length and time, and of a convenient scale for practical work as early as 1861. As of 2020, the definition of the ohm is expressed in terms of the quantum Hall effect.
Siemens; electrical conductance; S;;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_(unit); 1 kg−1⋅m−2⋅s3⋅A2; "The siemens (symbol: S) is the derived unit of electric conductance, electric susceptance, and electric admittance in the International System of Units (SI). Conductance, susceptance, and admittance are the reciprocals of resistance, reactance, and impedance respectively; hence one siemens is redundantly equal to the reciprocal of one ohm (Ω−1) and is also referred to as the mho. The 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures approved the addition of the siemens as a derived unit in 1971."
Weber;	magnetic flux; Wb; n,μ,m;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_(unit); 1 kg⋅m2^⋅s^−2⋅A^−1; "The weber (/ˈveɪb-, ˈwɛb.ər/ VAY-, WEH-bər; symbol: Wb) is the SI derived unit of magnetic flux. A flux density of one Wb/m2 (one weber per square metre) is one tesla."
Tesla; magnetic induction; T; n,μ,m;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit); 1 kg⋅s^−2⋅A^−1; The tesla (symbol: T) is a derived unit of the magnetic induction (also, magnetic flux density) in the International System of Units. One tesla is equal to one weber per square metre. The unit was announced during the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 and is named[1] in honour of Nikola Tesla, upon the proposal of the Slovenian electrical engineer France Avčin.
Henry; electrical inductance; H; n,μ,m;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_(unit); 1 kg⋅m^2⋅s^−2⋅A^−2; The henry (symbol: H) is the SI derived unit of electrical inductance.[1] If a current of 1 ampere flowing through a coil produces flux linkage of 1 weber turn, that coil has a self inductance of 1 henry.‌ The unit is named after Joseph Henry (1797–1878), the American scientist who discovered electromagnetic induction independently of and at about the same time as Michael Faraday (1791–1867) in England.
Lumen; luminous flux; lm;;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(unit); 1 cd⋅sr; The lumen (symbol: lm) is the SI derived unit of luminous flux, a measure of the total quantity of visible light emitted by a source per unit of time. Luminous flux differs from power (radiant flux) in that radiant flux includes all electromagnetic waves emitted, while luminous flux is weighted according to a model (a 'luminosity function') of the human eye's sensitivity to various wavelengths. Lumens are related to lux in that one lux is one lumen per square metre.
Lux; illuminance; lx;;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux; 1 cd·sr/m^2; The lux (symbol: lx) is the SI derived unit of illuminance, measuring luminous flux per unit area.[1][2] It is equal to one lumen per square metre. In photometry, this is used as a measure of the intensity, as perceived by the human eye, of light that hits or passes through a surface. It is analogous to the radiometric unit watt per square metre, but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function, a standardized model of human visual brightness perception. In English, 'lux' is used as both the singular and plural form.
Becquerel; radioactivity; Bq;;SI;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel; 1 s^−1; "The becquerel (English: /bɛkəˈrɛl/; symbol: Bq) is the SI derived unit of radioactivity. One becquerel is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second. For applications relating to human health this is a small quantity,[1] and SI multiples of the unit are commonly used."

Gauss; magnetic induction; G,Gs; n,μ,m;CGS;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_(unit); 1e−4 T; The gauss, symbol G (sometimes Gs), is a unit of measurement of magnetic induction, also known as magnetic flux density. The unit is part of the Gaussian system of units, which inherited it from the older CGS-EMU system. It was named after the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1936. One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimetre.
Phot; illuminance; ph; ;CGS;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phot; 10000 lx; A phot (ph) is a photometric unit of illuminance, or luminous flux through an area. It is not an SI unit, but rather is associated with the older centimetre–gram–second system of units. The name was coined by André Blondel in 1921.

Foot-candle; illuminance; fc, ft-c; ;US Customary;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-candle; 10.76 lux; "A foot-candle (sometimes foot candle; abbreviated fc, lm/ft2, or sometimes ft-c) is a non-SI unit of illuminance or light intensity. The foot-candle is defined as one lumen per square foot. This unit is commonly used in lighting layouts in parts of the world where United States customary units are used, mainly the United States.[1] Most of the world uses the corresponding SI derived unit lux, defined as one lumen per square meter."
