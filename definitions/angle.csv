Radian; angle; rad,r; μ,m;;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian; 1 m/m; The radian, denoted by the symbol [rad], is the SI unit for measuring angles, and is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics. The length of an arc of a unit circle is numerically equal to the measurement in radians of the angle that it subtends. One radian is 180/π  degrees or just under 57.3°.
Steradian; solid angle; sr; μ,m;;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian; 1 m²/m²; The steradian (symbol: sr) or square radian is the SI unit of solid angle. It is used in three-dimensional geometry, and is analogous to the radian, which quantifies planar angles. Whereas an angle in radians, projected onto a circle, gives a length on the circumference, a solid angle in steradians, projected onto a sphere, gives an area on the surface. The name is derived from the Greek στερεός stereos 'solid' + radian.
Degree of arc; angle; °,deg;;;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle); π/180 rad; A degree (in full, a degree of arc, arc degree, or arcdegree), usually denoted by ° (the degree symbol), is a measurement of a plane angle in which one full rotation is 360 degrees.
Minute of arc; angle; ′,arcmin;;;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc; 1/60°; A minute of arc, arcminute (arcmin), arc minute, or minute arc, denoted by the symbol ', is a unit of angular measurement equal to 1/60 of one degree.
Second of arc; angle; ″,arcsec;;;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc; 1/60′; A second of arc, arcsecond (arcsec), or arc second, denoted by the symbol ″, is 1/60 of an arcminute
Turn; angle; tr;;;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle); 360°; A turn is a unit of plane angle measurement equal to 2π radians, 360 degrees or 400 gradians. A turn is also referred to as a cycle (abbreviated cyc.), revolution (abbreviated rev.), complete rotation (abbreviated rot.) or full circle.
