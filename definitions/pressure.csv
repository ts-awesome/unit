Pascal; pressure; Pa; m,k,M;;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit);1 N/m²; The pascal (symbol: Pa) is the SI derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure, stress, Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength. The unit, named after Blaise Pascal, is defined as one newton per square metre and is equivalent to 10 barye (Ba) in the CGS system. The unit of measurement called standard atmosphere (atm) is defined as 101325 Pa.
Bar; pressure; bar; m,c;;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit);100,000 N/m²;The bar is a metric unit of pressure, but not part of the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as exactly equal to 100,000 Pa (100 kPa), or slightly less than the current average atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level (approximately 1.013 bar).[1][2] By the barometric formula, 1 bar is roughly the atmospheric pressure on Earth at an altitude of 111 metres at 15 °C.
Atmosphere; pressure; atm;;;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_atmosphere_(unit);1.01325 bar;The standard atmosphere (symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 Pa (1.01325 bar). It is sometimes used as a reference pressure or standard pressure. It is approximately equal to Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level.
Millimeters of Hg; pressure; mmHg;;;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre_of_mercury;133.322387415 Pa;A millimetre of mercury is a manometric unit of pressure, formerly defined as the extra pressure generated by a column of mercury one millimetre high, and currently defined as exactly 133.322387415 pascals.[1] It is denoted mmHg[2] or mm Hg.[3]
Pièze; pressure; pz;;;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi%C3%A8ze; 1kPa;The pièze (French: [pjɛz]) is the unit of pressure in the metre–tonne–second system of units (mts system), used, e.g., in the former Soviet Union 1933–1955. It is defined as one sthène per square metre. The symbol is pz.[1]
Torr; pressure;torr;;;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr; 1/760 atm;The torr (symbol: Torr) is a unit of pressure based on an absolute scale, defined as exactly 1/760 of a standard atmosphere (101325 Pa).
Barye; pressure; Ba;;;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barye; 0.1 Pa;The barye (symbol: Ba), or sometimes barad, barrie, bary, baryd, baryed, or barie, is the centimetre–gram–second (CGS) unit of pressure. It is equal to 1 dyne per square centimetre.[1]
Pounds per square inch; pressure; psi;;;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch; 6.894757 kPa;"The pound per square inch or, more accurately, pound-force per square inch (symbol: lbf/in2;[1] abbreviation: psi) is a unit of pressure or of stress based on avoirdupois units. It is the pressure resulting from a force of one pound-force applied to an area of one square inch. In SI units, 1 psi is approximately equal to 6895 Pa."
